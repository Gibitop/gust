# Development decisions log

## First toolchain

First toolchain will be implemented in the rust programming language. Later the toolchain will be ported to the gust language itself

## Gust project structure

Minimal gust project contains a single `.gust` file with a `main` function

## Syntax

Syntax is very similar to Rust. Notable differences:
- No semicolon
- No implicit return keyword
- All `::` are replaced with `.`
- Function return types are defined with `:` instead of `->`
- Function return types are optional and can be inferred by the compiler
- We prefer camelCase where rust uses snake_case
- No syntax for features missing by design or not implemented in this language yet (eg. life times, macros, etc)
- Imports are done very differently from rust. See the examples/milestone.gust file for an example. // TODO: replace with a module example, when modules are implemented

## String memory management

Gust will use garbage collection for managed values, including strings. Do not introduce ownership or lexical `free` semantics for strings as an interim design.

The current C backend may temporarily leak heap-allocated string concat results. Keep allocation isolated behind Gust-shaped runtime helpers, so raw `malloc` usage can later be replaced by GC allocation.

## Runtime development

Generated C should route operations that will later be runtime-managed through Gust-shaped helpers instead of calling C primitives directly.

## Generated C naming

Generated C reserves `gust_rt_*` for runtime helpers. User-defined symbols must not use this prefix.

User-defined functions should use deterministic internal names shaped like `gust_fn_<hash>_<source_name>` with a nearby comment containing the original Gust function name.

User-defined structs should use deterministic internal names shaped like `gust_struct_<hash>_<source_name>` with a nearby comment containing the original Gust struct name.

User-defined enums should use deterministic internal names shaped like `gust_enum_<hash>_<source_name>` with a nearby comment containing the original Gust enum name. The C backend represents enums as a tag plus a payload union.

Generated local variables and struct fields should use `gust_<source_name>`. Keep source-name suffixes sanitized so generated identifiers stay valid C identifiers.


## Equality

`==` and `!=` compare numeric and boolean values directly. Strings compare by value through a Gust runtime helper, never by backend pointer identity.

Struct and enum equality will be introduced with trait-based equality rather than receiving implicit field-by-field semantics.


## Logical operators

`!`, `&&`, and `||` operate only on boolean values.

`&&` and `||` evaluate left to right and short-circuit the right operand.
