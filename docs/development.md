# Development decisions log

## First toolchain

First toolchain will be implemented in the rust programming language. Later the toolchain will be ported to the gust language itself

## Gust project structure

Minimal gust project contains a single `.gust` file with a `main` function

## String memory management

Gust will use garbage collection for managed values, including strings. Do not introduce ownership or lexical `free` semantics for strings as an interim design.

The current C backend may temporarily leak heap-allocated string concat results. Keep allocation isolated behind Gust-shaped runtime helpers, so raw `malloc` usage can later be replaced by GC allocation.
